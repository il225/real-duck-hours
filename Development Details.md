### Scrum

#### Ideals
Estimate backlog work for a sprint\
backlog = todo in form of user stories\
Sprint = 2-3 week cycle of programming

#### Sprint Anatomy
Beginning of Each Sprint is Planning and Estimating\
Daily Standups replace lengthy meetings\
End of each sprint is a Retrospective and Review

#### Scrum Team Roster

- Decides what the product looks like
Devs 
- Develop the software
Quality Assurance (QA)
