# i wanna make snake the video game for tic-80 to run

# i also want to dabble in platformers and/or puzzle games but I have no experience

# i know that tic-80 can run python so I will start with pygame or smth idk

# snake pseudo code

open program  
press any key to start  
random apple spawns where snake isn't at  
speed should feel good-- not too difficult  
take inputs  (60 fps? 30? idk)  
make snake head extend while snake tail compress simultaneous  
make the snake grow from apple (tail doesn't extend past where it just compressed)
make the edges of screen kill  
make looping on yourself kill  
maybe add noise to indicate inability to 180 in one input  
(like when go right and input left, don't die or turn, just indicate move not allowed by a muffled boop or smthn)  
add buffer system


#### Cheat codes  

hard mode: snake faster  

easy mode: wall now doesn't instant kill, just removes one apple length from snake every turn it runs into wall

pallette changes  
snake is orange, apple now corn, background dark green
